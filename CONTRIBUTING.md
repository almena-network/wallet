# Contributing

Thanks for helping with the Almena Network wallet. By taking part you agree
to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Security issues go
through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), never through public issues.

## Getting started

You need Node with pnpm, a recent stable Rust and [Task](https://taskfile.dev),
plus the platform toolchains listed in the [README](README.md) for Android and
iOS.

```bash
task dev              # the desktop app with hot reload
task dev:web          # only the front end, in a browser
task deploy:android   # build and install on an Android device or emulator
task deploy:ios       # build and install on an iOS device or simulator
task --list           # everything else
```

## Making a change

- Open an issue first for anything larger than a small fix, so the approach
  can be agreed before the code.
- Everything is written in English: code, comments, docs, commit messages.
- No hard-coded user-facing text. A new string is a key in
  `src/i18n/messages/en.json` and `es.json`; a change with strings in only one
  catalogue is not done.
- Colours live only in `src/styles/global.css`, as tokens; components never
  name a colour of their own.
- Platform differences are decided on the Rust side with `cfg`, not by
  sniffing the user agent in the front end.
- The Android launcher icons under `src-tauri/icons/android` are drawn by
  hand; `task icons` regenerates everything else from `assets/branding`.
- Before sending a change, `task check` must pass: TypeScript, formatting,
  clippy with warnings as errors, and the Rust tests. If you touched code that
  only the phones compile, run `task check:mobile` too.

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) describes the layout of the code.
