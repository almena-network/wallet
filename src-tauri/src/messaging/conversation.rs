//! What was said in each relationship, one sealed file per conversation.
//!
//! **One file each, not one for everything**, so a message that arrives
//! rewrites its own conversation and nothing else, and opening the inbox never
//! reads a history. The files are sealed under the same key as the state
//! ([`super::state`]), and each is bound to its conversation's id, so one
//! cannot be passed off as another.
//!
//! A conversation's id is a hash of the pairwise DID this wallet speaks as in
//! it: stable, the same length for every file name, and it says nothing about
//! the DID without the DID.
