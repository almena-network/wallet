//! Messaging: the wallet's mediation with a DIDComm mediator, and the
//! relationships it has through it.
//!
//! A wallet has no address of its own, so it gets one from a mediator: it asks
//! for mediation (Coordinate Mediation 3.0), registers the DIDs it can be
//! reached at, and from then on anybody can reach one of them by wrapping a
//! message in a `forward` to the mediator, which queues it until the wallet
//! picks it up (Message Pickup 3.0). The protocols, and what the mediator
//! requires of them, are in the mediator's `docs/didcomm.md` §4–5.
//!
//! - [`peer`]: the DIDs the wallet speaks as — inbox, contact card, pairwise —
//!   all derived from the seed.
//! - [`mediator`]: finding a mediator and talking to it.
//! - [`contacts`]: invitations and the handshake that opens a relationship.
//! - [`chat`]: what is said once it is open — text, and each side's name.
//! - [`state`]: the mediator, this wallet's name and the relationships, sealed
//!   under the seed.
//! - [`conversation`]: what was said in each relationship, sealed the same way.
//! - [`live`]: a WebSocket to the mediator while the wallet is in front, down
//!   which messages arrive as they are sent.
//! - [`photo`]: the picture the wallet shows for its own identity.
//! - [`push`]: the device token the mediator notifies while the wallet is not
//!   running.
//! - [`call`]: the signalling of calls, and the TURN credentials they are
//!   relayed with (`SPEC.md` §3).
//!
//! Everything here needs the wallet open: every key and the state key come
//! from the seed, which is only held while it is.
