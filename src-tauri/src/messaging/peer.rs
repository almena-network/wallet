//! The DIDs this wallet speaks as, and the keys behind them.
//!
//! **Every one is derived from the seed, none is drawn at random**, so the same
//! words always make the same DIDs and nothing secret has to be written down
//! beside them. Each is a `did:peer:2` with an Ed25519 authentication key, an
//! X25519 key agreement key, and one service that routes through the mediator —
//! which is what lets a sender wrap a message in a `forward` for it. The
//! service is part of the DID, so the same keys through another mediator are
//! another DID.
//!
//! - **The inbox** (`m/1'`): the DID the mediation is keyed by. It talks to the
//!   mediator and nobody else ever sees it.
//! - **The contact card** (`m/4'`): the DID the wallet's invitation names, the
//!   one somebody writes to first. Shared on purpose; see `contacts`.
//! - **A pairwise** (`m/3'/…`): one per counterparty, derived from a hash of
//!   the counterparty's DID. It is the only DID that counterparty ever learns,
//!   so no two of them can tell they are talking to the same person.
