//! Almena Wallet.
//!
//! One code base for Android, iOS, macOS, Linux and Windows. What differs per
//! platform is decided here with `cfg`, never by sniffing in the front end —
//! which is why the front end asks [`platform_info`] instead.
//!
//! The plugin set differs per platform, because the platforms themselves do:
//!
//! - `single-instance` and `window-state` only exist on a computer. A phone runs
//!   one instance of an app and manages its window itself.
//! - `barcode-scanner` only exists on a phone or a tablet, where there is a
//!   camera the system lets an app drive to read a code.
//! - `deep-link` exists everywhere: an `almena://` link — the scheme the
//!   wallet's own invitations are written with — opens the wallet. On a
//!   computer a link opened while it runs arrives through `single-instance`.
//!
//! The tray is the other thing only a computer has, and it changes what closing
//! the window means: with a tray on the bar the wallet goes on running — live
//! delivery included — with nothing on screen, and the tray is where it is
//! ended. See [`tray`].
//!
//! [`window`] takes the window off the screen and brings it back, and puts a
//! restored window back on a screen that exists.
//!
//! [`backdrop`] is the colour behind the page and the appearance of the window
//! around it, both of which the window has to be told.
//!
//! [`scene`] is the second window an iPad offers, and why it is turned down.
//!
//! [`identity`] makes an identity from a phrase and holds its seed while the
//! wallet is open; [`vault`] keeps that seed on the device between launches,
//! encrypted behind a PIN. The seed never crosses to the front end.
//!
//! [`messaging`] is the wallet's mediation with a DIDComm mediator and the
//! relationships it has through it.
