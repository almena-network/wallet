//! Where the record is kept, which is not the same place on every system.
//!
//! **The platform's own secret store first.** On iOS and macOS that is the
//! Keychain, on Windows the Credential Manager, on Linux the Secret Service. It
//! is not chosen for secrecy alone — the record is already encrypted — but for
//! what it survives: a Keychain item outlives the app being deleted, so a wallet
//! reinstalled on the same phone finds its identity where it left it, which a
//! file inside the application's own container would not.
//!
//! **The store is named, never guessed.** `keyring-core` is given exactly one
//! store per platform and answers `NoDefaultStore` where it was given none. The
//! umbrella `keyring` crate would instead pick one for you, and the one it picks
//! on Android is an in-memory stub: it would look like it was working and lose
//! the identity on every launch. Nothing here can fail that way.
//!
//! **Android has no store this side can reach**, so nothing is registered there
//! and the record goes to the application's private storage, which no other
//! application can read and which survives an update. Reaching the Android
//! Keystore needs a Kotlin bridge and a JNI symbol the wallet does not have yet;
//! until it does, this is said out loud rather than implied.
//!
//! **macOS has two keychains, and this module uses both.** They are not
//! alternatives; each one is here for the thing the other cannot do.
//!
//! - The **file keychain** holds the record. Every build can reach it — signed,
//!   ad-hoc signed, or not signed at all — so an identity is never held hostage
//!   by how the copy of the wallet in front of somebody happened to be built.
//! - The **data protection keychain** holds the device key, because it is the
//!   only one on macOS whose items can carry `kSecAccessControlUserPresence`.
//!   In the file keychain there is no such thing: it hands its items to whoever
//!   is logged in, with no prompt, which is why opening without the PIN was not
//!   offered on a computer before this.
//!
//!   That store answers only to a build signed with an App ID a provisioning
//!   profile authorises; anything else gets `errSecMissingEntitlement` back. So
//!   it is asked once at startup, by putting an item in and taking it straight
//!   out again — see [`PROBE`] — and a build it will not answer for reports no
//!   device store rather than offering a switch that would fail on being used.
//!
//! Two things this is bound to on Apple platforms, and neither is obvious:
//!
//! - **A Keychain item belongs to the team and the bundle identifier together.**
//!   Changing `APPLE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` or the identifier in `tauri.conf.json`
//!   gives the next build a different access group, and the record already on
//!   the phone becomes unreachable — not corrupted, not deleted, simply somebody
//!   else's. The way back is the phrase.
//! - **The record is pinned to the device it was written on**, and the device key
//!   to the person. `when-unlocked-this-device-only` keeps the record out of
//!   every backup and off every other phone. `require-user-presence` makes the
//!   operating system itself ask for a face before it hands over the key that
//!   opens the wallet without a PIN — which is why the prompt is not decoration
//!   on iOS: it is `kSecAccessControlUserPresence`, enforced by the system
//!   rather than by a screen this wallet drew.
//!
//!   The store cannot ask for the two together. `apple-native-keyring-store`
//!   maps `require-user-presence` onto plain `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked`, so
//!   a device key armed beside a PIN is in the backup class and could be
//!   restored onto another phone. It opens nothing there: the record it would
//!   open is the one that stayed behind.
//!
//!   **Where the iPhone's lock is the only one, the key is written here
//!   instead** — [`set_device_lock`] — with both: the presence check and
//!   `when-passcode-set-this-device-only`. Face ID first, the passcode after
//!   it, never in a backup, and gone the moment the passcode is taken off the
//!   phone, at which point the phrase is the way back.
//!
//! Reading looks in both places, because a wallet whose store stopped answering
//! — a Linux session with no Secret Service running — must not conclude that
//! there is no identity. Writing goes to one place and clears the other, so
//! there is never a second, older copy to find.
