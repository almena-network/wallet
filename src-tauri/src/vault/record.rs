//! The record: what the wallet writes down, and what it takes to read it back.
//!
//! **One secret, wrapped twice.** A random data key encrypts the seed; the data
//! key itself is encrypted by a key the PIN derives. Where the platform has a
//! secret store, a copy of the data key goes there too, so a face opens the
//! wallet without the digits — see [`super::store`]. Either wrap opens it and
//! neither is the wallet, which is what lets a failed sensor not be the end of
//! an identity and a forgotten PIN not be either.
//!
//! **Or once, on an iPhone with a passcode.** There the device's own lock — the
//! face first, the passcode after it — is the only one, and the record carries
//! no PIN wrap at all: the copy in the Keychain is the one way in. Version 2 is
//! the version in which the PIN wrap may be missing.
//!
//! **The format carries its version and its own parameters.** A wallet installed
//! over an older one has to read what that one wrote, so nothing here is implied
//! by the code that reads it: the cost parameters, the salt and the nonces are
//! all in the record. A record from a newer wallet is refused by name rather
//! than misread.
//!
//! Nothing here reaches out. It turns bytes into a record and a record back into
//! bytes, which is what makes it testable without a device under it.
