//! The record: what the wallet writes down, and what it takes to read it back.
//!
//! **One secret, wrapped twice.** A random data key encrypts the seed; the data
//! key itself is encrypted by a key the PIN derives. The indirection is what
//! will let a second wrap — a copy of the data key the device holds behind a
//! face or a finger — open the same record later without re-sealing the seed.
//!
//! **The format carries its version and its own parameters.** A wallet installed
//! over an older one has to read what that one wrote, so nothing here is implied
//! by the code that reads it: the cost parameters, the salt and the nonces are
//! all in the record. A record from a newer wallet is refused by name rather
//! than misread.
//!
//! Nothing here reaches out. It turns bytes into a record and a record back into
//! bytes, which is what makes it testable without a device under it.
