//! Keeping the identity between launches.
//!
//! **This is what makes it a wallet.** Before it existed the seed lived in this
//! process and died with it, so every cold start asked for the phrase again —
//! which taught people to keep the phrase somewhere quick to reach, the one
//! place it must not be.
//!
//! What is written down is the seed and nothing else. The words are the
//! backup and the backup belongs to the person: a wallet that held them would
//! hold something that can be read aloud, photographed off a screen or typed
//! into somebody else's wallet, and would make the sentence every warning in the
//! product rests on untrue. The seed derives every key this wallet will ever
//! sign with, so keeping it is enough, and it cannot be turned back into words.
//!
//! Two things open the record and neither of them is the record: a PIN, and —
//! where the platform has somewhere to keep a key — the device. Either is
//! enough, which is what lets a sensor that stops recognising somebody not be
//! the end of an identity, and a forgotten PIN not be either. The format is in
//! [`record`]; where it is kept is [`store`].
//!
//! **The lock lives here now.** It used to be a PIN hash in memory beside the
//! seed; there is nothing left to hash, because a PIN is right if and only if
//! what it derives opens the record. Nothing that verifies a PIN is stored, so
//! there is nothing to steal and compare against, and the check is a message
//! authentication code rather than a comparison.
//!
//! **Every PIN goes through one door.** There is exactly one function that
//! checks digits, and it is the one that spends an attempt — because a check
//! that does not count is a wallet that can be guessed at forever through
//! whichever screen forgot to count. All of it happens under one lock, so two
//! answers arriving at once cannot both start from nine attempts left.
