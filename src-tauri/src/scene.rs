//! The second window an iPad offers, and why it is turned down.
//!
//! The wallet has one window, and a second copy of it beside the first would be
//! two views of one wallet, each believing it is the one in use.
//!
//! An iPad offers a second window anyway, because `Info.ios.plist` says the
//! application supports multiple scenes — and it says so because UIKit on the
//! iOS 27 SDK will not launch an application without a scene manifest, and tao,
//! the window layer under Tauri, only installs its scene delegate when the
//! manifest sets that flag. The flag is the price of starting; this module is
//! what keeps it from meaning anything.
//!
//! So when the system connects a scene that no window of ours asked for — the
//! person long-pressed the icon and chose *New Window*, or dragged the wallet
//! out in Stage Manager — the session behind it is asked to be destroyed
//! before it draws. The first scene is never reported here: tao emits the event
//! only for scenes beyond the one the wallet's window lives in.
